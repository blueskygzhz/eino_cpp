// Agent Interface Implementation
// ===============================
// This file provides helper functions for working with Agent interfaces.
// Most Agent functionality is defined as pure virtual interfaces in agent.h,
// but this file contains utilities for agent events and messaging.

// Agent interface implementations are mostly header-only (pure virtual).
// This file provides concrete helper functions.
